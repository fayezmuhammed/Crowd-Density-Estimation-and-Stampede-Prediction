This project aims to count the number of people in video/realtime and predict if a stampede will occur.

## Model Weights

The file `partBmodel_best.pth.tar` named as `best_csrnet_top.tar`  here is too large for GitHub (over 100MB). 
Please download it from the following link and rename it as such:

[`partBmodel_best.pth.tar`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zKn6YlLW3Z9ocgPbP99oz7r2nC7_TBXK/view)

the above file is part of the repository:
https://github.com/leeyeehoo/CSRNet-pytorch

NOTE: I did not train nor in anyway have any relation to the model stated above. All credit goes to the author.

### Instructions
1. Download the file from the link above.
2. Rename `partBmodel_best.pth.tar` to `best_csrnet_top.tar` and place the `best_csrnet_top.tar` file in the root directory of this project (same folder as this README).
3. Run `gui_app.py`.
